**When to Use:**

- Ambiguous or vague queries
- Domain-specific jargon
- Queries with abbreviations or shorthand

**Key Components:**

- HyDe prompt for document generation
- Two-step process: generate → embed → search

Query: "How does MMR work?"

Hypothetical Doc (generated):
"MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) is a retrieval strategy that balances
relevance with diversity. It works by first fetching a larger set of
candidate documents, then iteratively selecting documents that are both
relevant to the query and dissimilar to already selected documents..."

→ Embedding this detailed description finds better matches
```

Duration: ~10 minutes

---

### 07_adaptive_rag.ipynb

#### Query Complexity-Based Routing

Analyzes query complexity and routes to the optimal retrieval strategy (simple, MMR, or HyDe).

**When to Use:**

- Mixed workload systems
- Cost optimization (use simple retrieval when possible)
- Performance/quality balance

**Key Components:**

- LLM-based complexity classifier
- Router logic (SIMPLE → similarity, MEDIUM → MMR, COMPLEX → HyDe)
- Performance monitoring

**Example:**

```text
"What is FAISS?" → SIMPLE → Fast similarity search
"Compare vector databases" → MEDIUM → MMR for diversity
"How to architect production RAG with privacy constraints?" → COMPLEX → HyDe
```

Duration: ~12 minutes

- Out-of-domain queries
- Fact-checking applications

**Key Components:**

- Relevance grader (LLM-based)
- DuckDuckGo web search tool
- Quality threshold logic

**Example:**

```text
Query: "What is the latest LangChain version released in 2025?"

Vector DB retrieval → Low relevance (outdated docs)
→ Trigger web search → Find current information
→ Combine sources → High-quality answer
```

Duration: ~15 minutes

---

### 09_self_rag.ipynb

#### Self-Reflective RAG with Auto-Critique

LLM decides autonomously when to retrieve, evaluates its own responses, and retries if quality is low.

**When to Use:**

- Exploratory research
- High-quality requirements
- Systems requiring self-correction

**Key Components:**

- Retrieval need classifier
- Response self-critique
- Iterative refinement loop
- Citation validation

```text
Query: "What is 5 + 7?"

Retrieval need: NO (general knowledge)
→ Direct answer: "12"
→ Self-critique: SCORE 5 → Approved

Query: "What are MMR parameters in LangChain?"

Retrieval need: YES (specific info needed)
→ Retrieve docs → Generate answer
→ Self-critique: SCORE 3 → Retry with more context
→ Improved answer → SCORE 5 → Approved
```

Duration: ~20 minutes

```text
Query: "If I have 10,000 documents and process 1M tokens/day,
        should I use OpenAI or HuggingFace embeddings?"

Agent reasoning:
1. Thought: Need to calculate embedding costs
   Action: Calculator → Cost estimation
2. Thought: Need embedding comparison info
   Action: Knowledge Base → Retrieve comparison
3. Thought: Analyze privacy/cost trade-offs
   Final Answer: "HuggingFace is better for your use case because..."
```

## Shared Dependencies

All notebooks reuse components from `fundamentals`:

```python
# Shared utilities
from shared import (
    load_vector_store,          # Load pre-built vector stores
    RAG_PROMPT_TEMPLATE,        # Base prompts
    MEMORY_RAG_PROMPT,          # Memory-specific prompts
    HYDE_PROMPT,                # HyDe prompts
    # ... etc
)

# Shared artifacts
vectorstore_openai = load_vector_store("data/vector_stores/openai_embeddings", embeddings)
```

This avoids redundant embedding computation and ensures consistent baselines.

## Production Considerations

Before deploying any advanced architecture:

1. **Cost Analysis**: Track token usage with `tiktoken`
2. **Latency Monitoring**: Profile each component
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust fallbacks
4. **Caching**: Cache embeddings and frequent queries
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API overuse
6. **Logging**: Use LangSmith for tracing

See each notebook's "Production Optimizations" section for specific guidance.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Vector store not found"

- Solution: Run `fundamentals/02_embeddings_comparison.ipynb` first

**Issue**: "Module 'shared' not found"

- Solution: Ensure you're in the project root or adjust `sys.path`

**Issue**: "Rate limit exceeded"

- Solution: Add delays between API calls or use batch processing

**Issue**: "DuckDuckGo search fails"

- Solution: Check internet connection or use Tavily as alternative

See main `README.md` for full troubleshooting guide.
